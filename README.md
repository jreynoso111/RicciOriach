# Ricci Oriach Website Walkthrough

I have successfully created the high-fidelity landing page for Ricci Oriach using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Tropical Brutalism Design
- **Visuals**: Used a generated collage-style hero image and a dark, textured background to match the "Folclore Alternativo" aesthetic.
- **Typography**: Implemented `Abril Fatface` for that retro 70s serif look and `Outfit` for modern readability.
- **Colors**:
  - Primary: Guava Pink (#FF5E6C)
  - Background: Deep Forest Green (#0B3B2E)
  - Accents: Sun Yellow & Turquoise

### 2. Core Sections
- **Hero**: Large typography with outline/fill effects, floating tropical elements, and a clear CTA.
- **Navigation**: Fixed, glassmorphism-style navbar.
- **Tour Dates**: A stylish list of upcoming shows.
- **Footer**: Social links and copyright.

### 3. Interactivity
- **Parallax Effect**: The hero image moves slightly with the mouse cursor (desktop only).
- **Smooth Scroll**: Navigation links scroll smoothly to sections.
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons and links have dynamic hover states (glows, lifts).
